    This android app provides a service for students to order food from food trucks on campus. We started to design and have partially implemented the android interface, but we are still struggling to implement a few more features. That means, we recommend you to use our delicate command-line interface to have a full experience with our program. Because in Android we haven't implemented all functions, and haven't finished dealing with the style warnings in the use-case and entities layers that were mainly caused by unused methods.
  
    Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCqhwBWwrBnrb5dMkkQCLdbaphxzIfyo/view?usp=sharing) of our Android app. We have designed layouts and partially implemented features. in particular, you can try our user system, rating system, and login system.
  
    Thanks for your interests in ASOUL app, we are currently working on the market features and order features, so stay tuned. 


**Update:** 

  Current Status with the Android app and its reasons (important): we have created a runnable Android app with some of the functionalities mentioned above (namely all the login/register, user information, edit user info/truck info, serialization and so on). Within the Android app, we have designed the layout page for every single scene. However, due to our lack of experience with creating android app, along with many unexpected gradle and setting problems, we were unable to fully implement all the features that our full program supports.
  


**Update:** 

  Because of the unexpected error (we guess it's maybe because of gradle setting), our serialization fucntion of the Android App doesn't work currently. We will trying to fix it and resume it.


**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR RUNNING:**

After you clone the repository and try to run it from your machine, you might encounter the error "SDK path" not defined. To fix this, simply define a file called local.properties under the project folder and define your SDK path inside. For more details on where your SDK path might be, please see:
