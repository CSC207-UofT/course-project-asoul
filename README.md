This android app provides service for students to order food from FoodTrucks on campus. We started to design and partially implemented the android interface, but we are still struggling implementing a few more features. That means, we recommand you to use our delicated command line interface to have a full experience with our program.
Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCqhwBWwrBnrb5dMkkQCLdbaphxzIfyo/view?usp=sharing) of our Android app. We have designed layouts and partially implemented features. in particular, you can try our user system, rating system, and login system.
Thanks for your interests in ASOUL app, we are currently working on the market features and order features, so stay tuned. 


Update: 
  Current Status with the Android app and its reasons (important): we have created a runnable Android app with some of the functionalities mentioned above (namely all the login/register, user information, edit user info/truck info, and also serialization). Within the Android app, we have designed the layout page for every single scene. However, due to our lack of experience with creating android app, along with many unexpected gradle and setting problems, we were unable to fully implement all the features that our full program supports.
